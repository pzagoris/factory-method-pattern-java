# factory-method-pattern-java

The Factory Method design pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
The decision of which subclass to instantiate is made at compile time, which means that the type of object created is determined by the subclass used in the code.
